Hi, I’m Erika. I'm a fourth year PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder in the area of Systems and Networking. I’m currently interested in operating systems, distributed systems (especially serverless infrastructure), and networking. I am co-advised by Eric Rozner and Eric Keller, and generously supported by a 2021 Google PhD Fellowship. In addition to my serverless research at CU Boulder, I’ve been using ✨Rust✨ while I work on the [NrOS](https://github.com/vmware-labs/node-replicated-kernel) project, which has been a lot of fun! Learn more about me on my [webpage](https://hunhoffe.github.io/).
