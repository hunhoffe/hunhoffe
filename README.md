Hi, I’m Erika. I’m currently interested in operating systems, distributed systems (espeically serverless infrastructure), and networking. I’m currently learning ✨ rust ✨, which is a lot of fun! Learn more about me on my [webpage](https://hunhoffe.github.io/).

hunhoffe/hunhoffe is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
